### Petrinaut

**Petrinaut** is a framework for modeling distributed systems (and the world) using Petri nets.

Petrinaut was originally developed for use as part of the **[Safeguarded AI]** platform, and open-source, self-building **[HASH]** platform for trusted data and AI.

Petrinaut is also compatible with the **[Semtype]** standard for universally understandable and composable types.
